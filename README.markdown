# SCSS.sugar for Espresso
#### Adds SCSS support in MacRibbit's Espresso Text Editor

# jaymorgan added:

1. "a" to the "property-name.scss", because it keeps trying to change it to the azimuth property whenever you want to nest an a in another selector

2. added "inline-block" to "com.scss.property.display" in CodeSenseLibraries/SCSS.xml

3. added an "@function" completion snippet for doing functions. Don't know if this will work or not.
